StorageClass reclaim policy
---------------------------

TopoLVM does not care about `Retain` [reclaim policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#reclaim-policy)
because CSI volumes can be referenced only via PersistentVolumeClaims.

Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi

> The `csi` volume type does not support direct reference from Pod and may
> only be referenced in a Pod via a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object.
